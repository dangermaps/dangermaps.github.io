Singapore has a reputation for being a safe, peaceful, and orderly city. It was ranked the third safest city in the world, losing out on the top spots to Tokyo and Copenhagen in the 2021 Safe City Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Singapore was ranked as 24th safest country out of 136 countries in the Global Organized Crime Index 2021 by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.

While violent crime, theft, and crimes against persons are rare occurrences in the city-state, fraud and scams, especially those occurring online, are on the rise. Penalties for drug offences such as trafficking in Singapore are severe, and include the death penalty.

Scams
===

Scams and cybercrime continue to be a key concern in the city state. Scams may be orchestrated on the pretext of financially lucrative schemes (investments, venture capital and/or marketing), recruitment and job offers, identity and relationship, purchase of goods & services and crowdfunding. In 2022, about half of all crime reports were attributed to scams. As a crime of concern, the Singapore Police Force has separated scams from its annual crime number statistics.

From 2016 to 2022, the number of reported scam cases experienced a six-fold increase from 5,300 to over 30,000 cases. On a year-on-year basis, there were 31,728 reported scam cases in 2022, up from 23,933 cases in 2021 (32.6% increase). A total of $660.7 million were lost, up from $632 million in 2021.

The top five reported scams (2021 to 2022) by number of cases were related to phishing, jobs, e-commerce, investment and fake friend call (decreasing order). The phishing scams often involve malware installed on victims' Android devices to steal banking credentials. Since 2023, there has been at least 113 victims with total losses amounting to at least $445,000.

The top five reported scam cases (2021 to 2022) in terms of monetary losses were related to investments, jobs, impersonation of government officials, internet love, e-commerce (decreasing order). In 2022, there were 4,762 e-commerce scam cases and victims were cheated of $21.3 million – a 261% spike from the $5.9 million lost in 2021. In 2022, victims of investment scams lost $198.3 million – the highest amount lost among all scam types. This was more than the $190.2 million lost to scammers in 2021.

To combat the rising incidence of scams, the Singapore authorities amended/passed bills and set up the Anti-Scam Command (ASCom) under the Singapore Police Force. Initiatives and measures include the following:

-    Amended the Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA), Computer Misuse Act (CMA) and introduced Online Criminals Harm Act (OCHA) in 2023
-    Launched and refreshed the anti-scam campaign
-    Collaborating with law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, Macau and Malaysia to deal with transnational scams
-    Launched ScamShield app for iOS and Android phone users
-    Deploying bank staff to expedite the process of identifying and freezing fraudulent transactions and accounts
-    Maintaining a SMS Sender ID Registry under the Infocomm Media Development Authority to flag potential scam messages

Loss & Recovery Effort
---

The time taken for money to be returned to the victims depends on the circumstances. Factors include whether there are multiple claimants and if the money is still relevant for the purposes of investigation or trial or other court proceedings. Important considerations would be the speed at which the victim(s) acts (such as making the police report), the speed at which the funds are transferred to other jurisdictions, and the ability to trace and freeze these funds wherever they may be traced to. Victims may also be referred to making a magistrate complaint against the perpetrators.

Rates of crimes of foreign workers
===

In December 2013 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: "[Foreign workers'] crime rates are, in fact, lower than Singaporeans in general." In January 2014, Lina Chiam of Singapore People's Party asked in Parliament, the breakdown of crimes committed by Singaporeans, permanent residents and foreigners respectively between 2009 and 2013. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean replied that during the period, more than 18,000 persons were arrested each year, of which 20% were foreigners with an arrest rate of 272 per 100,000 foreigners, while the arrest rate for residents was 385 per 100,000 residents. No breakdown between Singaporeans and permanent residents was given.

Human trafficking
===

Singapore is a transit and destination country for human trafficking. Individuals trafficked from other South and South-east Asian countries are often rendered vulnerable to sex or labour exploitation through various means. Employers are known to regularly withhold pay, restrict the movements of their victims and commit physical and sexual abuse. The economic fall out caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have made certain communities in the region more vulnerable to trafficking. Regarding human smuggling, Singapore has seen a decrease in cases as authorities have become better at detecting concealed individuals at land and sea checkpoints. However, at the same time, criminal organizations have developed more sophisticated methods of human smuggling, including the procurement of genuine and fraudulent travel documents.

Sex trafficking in Singapore is a significant problem. Singaporean and foreign women and girls have been forced into prostitution in brothels and been physically and psychologically abused.

Crime deterrence
===

The National Crime Prevention Council of Singapore maintains a web portal Scam Alert that offers scam prevention campaign posters and also encourages victims to come forward to share their stories.

The Neighbourhood Watch Zone scheme was formed in 27 April 1997 and today includes the Citizens On Patrol (COP) initiative, which conducts regular foot patrol with community policing. Officers go around each neighbourhood to project police presence and to disseminate crime prevention pamphlet to the residents.

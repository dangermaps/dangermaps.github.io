	Kyiv is very safe city, even despite the war, staying here is safer than any country in Europe. Tons of police and army, no night crime, cause the curfew is from 23:00 to 05:00. You can walk alone and nobody would ever rob you or threaten you. No need to worry for car to get stolen (only couple models get stolen, but before buy you should avoid those models). There is no armed robberies here at all. No race crimes either. I welcome everybody to travel here, Ukraine changed a lot since 2020.

	I have visited Ukraine 4 times since 2016. Staying 1-4 weeks each trip and traveling in Kyiv, Odessa, and Lviv and many smaller cities and towns. I always felt safe. But as always tourists, or anyone, in a big city needs to be vigilant. Criminals prey on the weak and vulnerable.
	I have also traveled extensively in the United States and Western Europe- I never felt safe but stayed vigilant. No problems.
	I live near Seattle and when I venture there I am on high alert.

	I am Bangladeshi I was born in Bangladesh. I am a very ordinary person.
	Now I live in Ukraine. I am a student. I am studying English Philology. I paid one year's tuition fee. My university name is University European University Kiev. But the person I paid tuition fee is a teacher in the foreign department of this university. His name is Karim. He took my money down without paying my tuition fees. It is not possible for me now to return to the country and renew my visa. But immigration to this country canceled my student card. Why was I dismissed? There was nothing wrong with me. University made a mistake.
	Now I am appealing to the government to re-educate me. That gave me back my student card
	To give the opportunity to study in the university.

	I just returned from my first trip to Ukraine (Feb. 2020). Spent most of our time in Vinnytsia but finished out our trip in Kyiv. The city was beautiful and we never felt unsafe. One of our hosts is was a 60+ year old woman from the US who has lived in Kyiv for 25 years and she walks freely by herself. Our last evening in the city one of my companions and I decided to go out and have one last vodka to finish out the trip. It was a Wednesday night and we went out at about 11 PM. We were staying near the Opera House and walked for quite a while before we found an open bar. We returned about 1 AM. We saw a good number of people out that evening and never felt unsafe. The only time we were approached was by a guy asking us for a light for his cigarette. Our whole group said that this was one of our favorite trips yet (we work for a US University and had just returned from a trip to Ghana before coming to Ukraine) and wished we had more time to just hang out and enjoy the city.

	Omg. Ive been travelling to kiev for over 4 years and have been probably been over 30 times. I've never seen any trouble. Every one has treated me with respect and kindness. Im sure there are districts that are not pleasant but as a tourist (reasonably well travelled)you will love kiev.

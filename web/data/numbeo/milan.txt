Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a given city or country. We consider crime levels lower than 20 as very low, crime levels between 20 and 40 as low, crime levels between 40 and 60 as moderate, crime levels between 60 and 80 as high, and crime levels higher than 80 as very high.

	The truth is most cities in Europe are not safe anymore as they were before. And im talking from experience since im an immigrant of 1st generation who was born here. The reality of the safe europe is not real anymore. Migrants have taken iver the cities, it's not a safe place for people like me whenever you go to places where there are strict white people, they will profile you based on your skin color. Most of the times it doesnt happen, but watch out. Most migrants, us, live in the northern part of the city, in the hood near the football stadium. The underground stations are full of migrant people the more far you go. But theres also plenty of us in the city centre. Europe is different from USA but not in the case of migrants: indian people, pakistani, south african but very very much north people from marocco and algeria come here. There is also a chinese hood but thats near the city centre and is usually full of tourists. So if you are coming here to stay for a couple of nights remember to watch out for people that have: low cut fade (applies to most of italians, white), black nike Tn shoes, perm cut(white people but also some north africans), nike tech zip,louis vuitton mens bags, crossbody nike bags etc.. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY AN HOUSE HERE, ITS VERY EXPENSIVE AND USUALLY IF YOU WILL DECIDE TO RENT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME, PEOPLE IS MOVING OUT OF THE CITY.

	The city is definitely not safe. The lax policies of the left have caused crime to rise (as the data show) overwhelmingly. Most violent crime is committed at the hands of migrants. The leftist ruling city council has done enormous amounts of damage.

	This city has been bombed by media and politician from far-right parties saying that it's the most dangerous city in the world, just because the mayor has been from the centre-left and has now won another mandate. It is generally a very safe city, even though you should pay attention to some sort of big-city scams in the city centre, like anywhere in the world I'd say

	As any big city you shall pay attention to pickpocking in busy areas, but other than that its a safe city and a really nice place to visit/live

	Back in December 2018, I have went to that city and nothing happened to me at all. I was not mugged, robbed, or insulted.

Crime in Birmingham, United Kingdom

Crime Index: 	63.03
Safety Index: 	36.97

Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a given city or country. We consider crime levels lower than 20 as very low, crime levels between 20 and 40 as low, crime levels between 40 and 60 as moderate, crime levels between 60 and 80 as high, and crime levels higher than 80 as very high.
Safety index is, on the other way, quite the opposite of the crime index. If the city has a high safety index, it is considered very safe.

	Absolute worst place in the world full of thugs and foreigners probably the most run down city in the uk, public transport is terrible, the only food you can get is Indian or fried chicken, the locals are really unfriendly and you have to constantly check your surroundings just to make sure it’s safe anyone thinking of moving here I would suggest otherwise

	Worst place I’ve ever lived everywhere stinks and is like living in a slum I’ve lived hear for 2 years and have already been burgled, robbed by a crackhead for my bike and have witnessed countless brawls and stabbings however there are places worth visiting or living in but the risk definitely outweighs the reward

	As a white person who lives in a “non white area” I can tell you I have never been robbed or attacked and feel safer than when I lived in my white area kingstanding I live in bordesley green now and to be honest there is no such thing as a non white area it’s just something racists made up to make immigration look bad but forget that Birmingham is dangerous especially if your an outsider if you are going to visit stick to city centre or more tourist friendly areas like harbourne, edgebaston and Solihull but even then be careful as inner city thugs often patrol the suburbs committing street robbery’s

	A Somalian guy stabbed 8 people in the city centre and it surprised no one. Crime has increased along with ethnic minority culture and joblessness among the youth. Postcode gangs have a long history in Brum, and migrants from the third world have made it more deadly. If you’re white, don’t go looking for trouble out at night or even daytime in some areas. Best to live in somewhere like Shirley but soon I’m sure BLM racists will come through anyway asking for reparations with knives.

	Alot of illegal immigrants here doing alot of crime, just saying how it is. Crime is very high, the city is not safe.

	sorry but I really don't think anyone should be holding Muslims against crimes. there are 9 out of 10 white people who commit crimes and are paedophiles, but when it comes to white people the world is blind. so whoever is talking rubbish seriously needs o do their research.

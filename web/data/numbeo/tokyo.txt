Crime in Tokyo, Japan

Crime Index: 	23.97
Safety Index: 	76.03

Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a given city or country. We consider crime levels lower than 20 as very low, crime levels between 20 and 40 as low, crime levels between 40 and 60 as moderate, crime levels between 60 and 80 as high, and crime levels higher than 80 as very high.
Safety index is, on the other way, quite the opposite of the crime index. If the city has a high safety index, it is considered very safe.

	I only go there 5 time a year for the part 24 years ago. Nice place to eat shrimp and lobster.

	I'm viewing the "Crime" page and can confirm that Japan is fairly crime free. Even in Tokyo, where I live. You can go for a walk carrying 20,000 yen with you at 23:30 down a deserted alley (although why you would want to do that is beyond my comprehension) and not have to worry about a thing. Even if you're a 5'4" female, drunk and alone.
	In comparison, in the UK (my home country) you wouldn't want to be out and vulnerable like that at night unless you're with a male or group of friends.

	Tokyo is genuinely really safe. I've visited many times and never had a problem. There are probably a few pickpockets about, and of course some crimes do happen, but sensible precautions will reduce the risk. Mugging seems very rare - it feels safe to walk the streets at any time.

	I lived there for a few years, and I believe it's one of the safest capitals in the world, where you can walk the streets in the middle of the night without fear.

	In response to Rohail, its safe because of their culture of fear of shame.

	I don't get how even with the high population, the crime rates are low?

	Very, very safe -about as safe as you can get for a big city.
	Not saying there's no crime, but so long as you are not a total idiot, you will be completely fine.

	Tokyo is paradise for one and all! Most of these comments are ridiculous! When Western cities like Portland, London and San francisco are burning due to riots and Covid has hit the UK, continental Europe(Paris to Stockholm) and with Neo nazis and street gangs roaming the streets of western Europe/American cities intimidating people, robbing and raping as they please, homeless everywhere across Europe, Australia and Americas etc, Japan alone stands as a beacon of hope and positivity amongst civilizations. All people, including foreign women and people of color are extremely safe in Tokyo or anywhere else in Japan. Most of these commentators are probably angry whites who have'nt travelled beyond their trailer parks/flea infested shitties(cities?)

	Safe, but women should just stay as far away from the subway as possible during rush hour. Groping is very common.

	Tokyo is so safe that people have nothing else to write but silly things

	The government actually created rommba for lazy people who don't want to vacuum so they can map out their house and eliminate them.If you have a Roomba then the government already knows where you live, what you identify as, your name, your gender, your phone model, your fetishes and when you sleep. He knows your local supermarket and how much you spend on groceries when when you do shopping. He knows what shoes wear because rommba has high sensing devices that can detect anything as said in their advertisement. He also knows that you listen to despacito on loop even though you try to hide it. To conclude, Roombas are actually created by the government to eliminate people who can't vacuum, so you should just sell it to your neighbour or on Gumtree. Or you can give it to me

	I really must say, Japan has changed a lot over the last 40 years. I remember I used to be able get a hooker for 20 bucks but not in this day and age!

	No longer safe as it used to be. Insults and hate speech becoming a popular trend

	Compared to most other major cities, Tokyo is very safe.
	There are of course crimes in the city like any city.
	I'm a woman and I often walk around in the late evenings and nights in central Tokyo in crowded and uncrowded area and I've rarely felt I need to look over my shoulder. I even visited and small empty park at night and was okay!
	I think areas like Kinshicho, Shinjuku and Shibuya have a lot of activity as night so if you're alone, drunk and not aware of your surrounding very late into the night, then yes, it can be dangerous. However, most areas are very safe.

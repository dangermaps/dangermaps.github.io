Crime in Singapore, Singapore

Crime Index: 	23.59
Safety Index: 	76.41

Crime Index is an estimation of the overall level of crime in a given city or country. We consider crime levels lower than 20 as very low, crime levels between 20 and 40 as low, crime levels between 40 and 60 as moderate, crime levels between 60 and 80 as high, and crime levels higher than 80 as very high.
Safety index is, on the other way, quite the opposite of the crime index. If the city has a high safety index, it is considered very safe.

	Surprising numbers! Is there anyone worrying about crime in Singapore? One can sleep naked on the lobby floor and nothing will happen!

	Yes itâ€™s an unprecedented exponential spike! Govt is not addressing yet!

	Scams, molestations, voluntarily causing hurt/fightings, riots and other violent crimes are increasing if you look at the frequency of reports since start of last year.

	Woah Singapore! I thought it was a very safe city! I know 39 isnt bad but i was expecting 20-25

	Wonder where some of these numbers are coming from. Would expect most metrics e.g. "Problem corruption and bribery" and "Worries home broken and things stolen" to be close to zero. But index numbers are coming out in the 20s and 30s. Is there seriously anyone here that worries about home broken into or corruption in Singapore?

	Geylang is fairly safe except for occasional fights, many of the sexual services have moved to neighborhoods or in rented condominiums. Theft still prevalent in some districts. Covid is so well controlled that most residents don't wear masks other than in public transport and malls.

	Incredibly safe country with very low safety risk, but be cautious of red light districts like Orchard Towers and Geylang, you can get scammed or worse.

	My god, why are people bombing cities' safety index? Singapore is literally one of the safest countries in the world.

	A few time after drinking i forget to close my door , sleep soundly and safely till sun rise . Ever did leave my laptop on the table to go to toilet and came back 10mins later and is still there ! This ranking is super wrong , very few city/country can you experience this.

	This is untrue as there are many people smoking in Singapore and this exposes non-smokers to toxic secondhand smoke which contains nicotine and many cancer-causing substances. If only smoking is banned in Singapore and more enclosed smoking chambers are constructed in Singapore to protect the general public from inhaling the noxious incense and cigarette smoke.
	If you head down to Blk 65A Circuit Road Singapore 370065, you would have noticed many people smoking illegally at the multi-purpose hall and endangering the safety of patrons to coffee shops. Smoking should be banned in Singapore so as to prolong life expectancy. I am really frustrated by the littering habits of some Singaporeans especially in the poorer districts of Singapore which results in an unsightly neighbourhood.

	There is almost no crime. But avoid red districts like Geylang and be careful with people trying to scam you online or in some shops. That's about it.

	I grew up and live in Singapore. Very safe, like comments below mentioned, even ladies can take night walks in 3-4am in most places except geylang. If there are tourist whose hotel is in geylang, I suggest traveling in a group, never alone. However, during the day, it's safe to go explore the eateries in geylang alone.
	One place that tourist should avoid is sim lim square, as tourists are more likely to get scammed there. Be extra weary if an offer seems too good to be true, especially if you're asked to sign something.

	Well hey, they don't call Singapore a very "fine" city for nothing!

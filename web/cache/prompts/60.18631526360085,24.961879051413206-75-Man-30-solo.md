Finnland: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise
Stand - 19.07.2023
(Unverändert gültig seit: 14.07.2023)
Sicherheit
Terrorismus
Die zuständige finnische Sicherheitspolizei (SUPO) hat die Gefährdung durch Terrorismus auf Stufe zwei (erhöht) von insgesamt vier festgesetzt.
-    Beachten Sie den weltweiten Sicherheitshinweis.
Kriminalität
Die Kriminalitätsrate in Finnland ist niedrig. Insbesondere zur Reisezeit kann es aber an viel besuchten Orten oder in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu Taschendiebstählen kommen.
-    Bewahren Sie Geld, Ausweise, Führerschein und andere wichtige Dokumente sicher auf; speichern Sie ggf. elektronische Kopien/Fotos. Dies erleichtert im Falle von Diebstahl oder Verlust die Ausstellung eines Ersatzdokuments.
-    Bevorzugen Sie bargeldlose Zahlungen und nehmen Sie nur das für den Tag benötigte Bargeld und keine unnötigen Wertsachen mit.
-    Seien Sie in größeren Menschenmengen wie an Flughäfen, Bahnhöfen, in der U-Bahn, im Bus besonders aufmerksam und achten Sie auf Ihre Wertsachen.
-    Seien Sie bei ungewohnten E-Mails, Telefonanrufen, Gewinnmitteilungen, Angeboten und Hilfeersuchen angeblicher Bekannter skeptisch. Teilen Sie keine Daten von sich mit, sondern vergewissern Sie sich ggf. persönlich oder wenden Sie sich an die Polizei.
Natur und Klima
Finnland liegt zu einem Viertel nördlich des Polarkreises. Es gibt große klimatische Unterschiede zwischen dem Norden und dem Süden.
Im Winter kann es zu extremer Kälte und auch schwerem Schneefall kommen.
In den Sommermonaten besteht in längeren Trockenperioden eine erhöhte Waldbrandgefahr.
-    Verfolgen Sie aufmerksam die Nachrichten und Wetterberichte.
-    Beachten Sie stets Verbote, Hinweisschilder und Warnungen sowie die Anweisungen lokaler Behörden.
Reiseinfos
Infrastruktur/Verkehr
Finnland verfügt über gute öffentliche Verkehrsmittel wie ein dichtes Inlandsflugnetz, Eisenbahnen und Busverbindungen. Gute Informationen bieten die Webseiten von VR (finnische Bahn) und HSL (öffentliche Verkehrsmittel in Helsinki). Eine einheitliche Plattform für Verkehrsdienstleistungen einschließlich Leihfahrräder und Taxis im Raum Helsinki und Umgebung bietet die Whim App.
Aktuelle Informationen zu Verkehrsbehinderungen und Straßenzuständen bietet die Webseite von Fintraffic.
Die gesetzliche Höchstgeschwindigkeit auf Autobahnen beträgt für Pkw 120 km/h (im Winter 100 km/h) und auf Landstraßen 80 km/h. Die Höchstgeschwindigkeit wird im Winter mancherorts herabgesetzt. Innerorts sind maximal 50 km/h zulässig. Abweichende Regelungen sind möglich. Die Beschilderung ist genau zu beachten. In Finnland gilt auf mehrspurigen Straßen das Rechtsfahrgebot. Im dünn besiedelten Norden des Landes sind die Abstände zwischen Tankstellen zum Teil groß, sodass rechtzeitig getankt werden sollte.
Alkoholkontrollen sind häufig. Die Promillegrenze beträgt 0,5 Promille (Blutalkoholwert). Verkehrsdelikte ziehen zum Teil sehr hohe und einkommensabhängige Bußgelder nach sich, falsche Angaben zur Einkommenshöhe sind strafbar, siehe Rechtliche Besonderheiten.
Inner- und außerorts muss auch tagsüber mit Abblendlicht gefahren werden. Fernlicht und Nebelscheinwerfer dürfen nur bei entsprechenden Wetterverhältnissen benutzt werden.
Wildwechsel-Warnschilder sind unbedingt zu beachten. Elche oder Rentiere überqueren häufig die Straße, vor allem in der Dämmerung und insbesondere in den Monaten Mai, Juni, Oktober und November.
Wenn es die Witterungs- oder Straßenbedingungen erfordern, müssen vom 1. November bis 31. März Winterreifen verwendet werden. Winterreifen mit Spikes können vom 1. November bis 31. März und auch in anderen Zeiträumen verwendet werden, wenn die Wetter- oder Straßenbedingungen dies erfordern.
Die Mitnahme der „Internationalen Versicherungskarte für den Kraftverkehr/Grüne Deckungskarte“ wird dringend empfohlen. Sie dient bei Fahrten ins Ausland als Nachweis, dass das Auto Kfz-haftpflichtversichert ist und kann bei einem Unfall in Finnland die Regulierung des Schadens deutlich vereinfachen.
LGBTIQ
Es gibt keine Hinweise auf besondere Schwierigkeiten, die Akzeptanz ist insbesondere in Großstädten gut ausgeprägt.
Hinweise für LGBTIQ
Verhaltenshinweise vor Ort
Sie unterliegen stets den Gesetzen des jeweiligen Reiselandes. In vielen Ländern können einvernehmliche gleichgeschlechtliche sexuelle Aktivitäten, öffentliche Versammlungen oder das Zeigen von LGBTIQ-Symbolen wie der Regenbogen-Flagge illegal sein.
Das Einverständnisalter für hetero- und homosexuelle Beziehungen kann auch im selben Land variieren. Ihr Verhalten kann in einigen Ländern auch Einheimische gefährden und eine öffentliche Geste der Zuneigung die andere Person ihren Job, die Familie oder gar ihr Leben kosten.
-    Seien Sie besonders umsichtig, wenn Sie Kontakt zur lokalen Bevölkerung aufnehmen. In einigen Ländern überwacht die Polizei Webseiten, mobile Dating-Apps oder Treffpunkte bzw. nimmt LGBTIQ-Personen gezielt über Fake-Accounts ins Visier.
-    Verhalten Sie sich im Zweifel diskret, lassen Sie sich nicht auf Diskussionen am falschen Ort ein, sondern reagieren Sie einfach nicht und verlassen Sie den Ort möglichst. Dies schließt je nach Schwere eines Vorfalls die Möglichkeit auch einer Anzeige bei Behörden nicht aus.
-    Lassen Sie Speisen und Getränke nicht unbeaufsichtigt. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass ihnen unbemerkt Substanzen wie K.o.-Tropfen beigemischt werden. Drogenaktivierte Vergewaltigungen sind weltweit verbreitet. Beachten Sie, dass in einigen Ländern Vergewaltigungsopfer (des anderen wie auch des gleichen Geschlechts) als Täter einer Straftat angesehen werden können.
-    Achten Sie auf Safer Sex, da einige Länder eine höhere Rate an sexuell übertragbaren Infektionen (STI) haben, insbesondere in der LGBTIQ-Gemeinschaft. In vielen Ländern, insbesondere Entwicklungsländern, haben viele Menschen keinen Zugang zu HIV-Tests.
Rechtliche Besonderheiten
Alkoholkonsum in der Öffentlichkeit ist (außer in Restaurants, Bars und anderen lizensierten Schankbetrieben sowie in privaten Fahrzeugen und Taxis) verboten, wird aber meistens toleriert, solange nicht gleichzeitig die öffentliche Ordnung gestört wird (z.B. auf öffentlichen Straßen, Parkanlagen und vergleichbaren Plätzen).

General crime information about Finland from Wikipedia:
<<<BEGIN[wikipedia]
Crime in Finland is combated by the Finnish police and other agencies.
Crime by type
Murder
In 2021, Finland had a total of 105 homicides + 23 negligent homicides.
Half of murders involve men of specific groups (unemployed, undereducated, drug and alcohol problems) in heavy drinking situations. Thirty-five percent of homicides are committed by family members, and ten percent of homicides are classified as youth violence.
Women constitute 10 percent of offenders and 25 percent of victims. The vast majority of female offenders target a husband or other family member. Twenty-three percent of homicide victims of male offenders were strangers. Fewer than 20 percent of murders are committed outdoors.
Firearms are used in 14 percent of the cases. Street shootings and gang violence are extremely rare. A few cases involving motorcycle gangs have occurred in recent years, attracting national attention.
Sexual violence
In 2018, 1393 cases of rape were reported to the police. According to official statistics, 27.0% of rapes have been committed by foreigners in Finland, who comprise 2.2% of population. In contrast, the rape support helpline Tukinainen reports that 6% of all callers and 11% of 10–20-year-old callers say that the rapist was a foreigner. Finnish rapists are more likely to be known personally by the victim, increasing the threshold to report. Furthermore, there are great asymmetries between nationalities of rapists.
Financial crime
Finland has been known to give low sentences for financial crimes such as cartel behaviour, insider trading, and tax evasion. The sentences are especially low when compared with the potential benefits of committing such crimes, as well as when compared with international standards. An example of the difference between sentence and benefits is the 2006 case of Lemminkäinen Group. Lemminkäinen was hit with a €68,000,000 fine for cartel. This was markedly lower than the estimated €400,000,000 Lemminkäinen would have made, if it had received just 20% of the criminal profit. Executives were not sentenced to prison or fined for their involvement.
Examples of cartels in Finland include: Metsäliitto and Stora Enso who were sentenced €500,000 and Elisa which was sentenced €4,160,000 in 2001. The European Union has given much higher sanctions for cartels, as seen in the cases of UPM-Kymmene (€56,000,000), Outokumpu (€36,000,000), and Kemira (€33,000,000).
Fraud and embezzlment also occur. For example, in 2018 there was a scandal over IT supplies in schools in Helsinki
Corruption
Political corruption levels are extremely low and previously Finland was annually named the least corrupted country for years. The number of notices of corruption related crimes were lower than the murder rate in 2007—there were about 15 reports of bribery or attempted bribery annually. In 2006, there were 115 reports of corruption. One-fourth of these involved seeking private gain. One-third of the cases were attempts to harm someone rather than seek gain. Between 2002 and 2007, no corporations were fined and no business prohibitions were imposed for committing bribery.
A campaign funding controversy that began in 2008 has eroded the confidence in the transparency of Finnish politics. Finland's Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index ranking has dropped to 5th place. The continuing controversy began with a remark by a Centre Party MP that he had not disclosed his funding sources because, despite the obligation, there was no punishment for avoiding it coded in the law. Later it was found a group of property developers had supported certain MPs of the three major parties (Centre Party, National Coalition and Social Democratic Party) allegedly to produce favorable zoning decisions.
Furthermore, MPs of the government-leading Centre Party had funneled public funds to party-associated foundations that had subsequently funded the personal campaigns of Centre Party politicians, including Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen. There are criminal investigations ongoing by the National Bureau of Investigation. Incomplete disclosure of funding sources was the problem of the two other major parties.
Organised crime
The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation is aware of the existence of approximately ninety criminal gangs with a total membership of around eight-hundred. There are several competing motorcycle gangs in Finland. A historic rivalry between the Hells Angels and Bandidos erupted in the Nordic Biker War in the 1990s. Other international biker gangs operating in the country include the Diablos, Outlaws, Red Devils and Satudarah, as well as Cannonball, a prominent domestic organisation.
Along with these motorcycle gangs, there are other criminal organisations without the same principles as in biker groups such as Bats, United Brotherhood and X-Team, a Bandidos sub-division. United Brotherhood, a merger of the former Natural Born Killers, Rogues Gallery and M.O.R.E. gangs, utilizes the drug trade, financial crimes and security services as sources of income. In 2013, the police raided a suspected United Brotherhood member's home and found 47 firearms, 18 of which were capable of sustained rapid fire, along with drugs, doping substances and jewellery. In 2018, 30 weapons including sub-machine guns were seized from the same group. In 2019, a crackdown saw these gangs and any related clothing or symbols banned.
Street gangs
A recent phenomenon affecting some major cities.
Crime dynamics
Guns
Finland is an average European country in the terms of gun ownership, with about 1.5 million guns in register and 30 guns for every 100 people. A bulk of this number consists of hunting weapons and there are only 220 000 pistols and revolvers on the register. A persistent myth claims that Finns would have the fourth most firearms in the world per capita (right after United States, Yemen, Switzerland), with around 45.3 guns for every 100 people. This false number rises from the Small Arms Survey, which claimed in 2007 that there would be 800 000 unregistered guns in addition to the registered ones. This claim has been since refuted and has no basis in reality according to the Finnish officials, who estimate the amount of illegal guns to be "in thousands", with a significant amount of them being over 80 years old war trophies. Also, Finland registers OC sprays and other spray-based weapons with a gun license, adding to the gun ownership total. Many other European countries, such as Germany, do not require a license to carry an OC spray in public. Finland has a high incidence of gun related deaths including suicides, but in gun-related homicides, it is the fifth-ranking country in the EU.
Guns and other weapons are tightly regulated. One must separately apply for a gun license, which cannot be issued for "self defense reasons". Even other weapons, such as pepper sprays, are regulated. Carrying weapons, including guns and knives in public is not allowed. "police have received about 230 reports annually of theft or aggravated theft involving firearms"
Alcohol and criminality
The majority of criminals and victims of violent crime are under the influence of alcohol during the act. Statistics show that in homicides 61 to 75 percent, in attempted homicides 71 to 78 percent and in assaults 71 to 73 percent of the offenders have been under the influence of alcohol. During the last two decades the number of drunk offenders has increased. Roughly half of the crimes of theft involve the use of alcohol.
Drugs
The Finnish drug market is stable, with cannabis type drugs most commonly used and seized by law enforcement agencies, while amphetamines, MDMA/ecstasy and other synthetic psychoactive substances and narcotic pharmaceuticals remain important. There is very low heroin use. Opioids are a significant part of the addiction market. There is a large amount of smuggling of snuff called snus from Sweden.
Around 6000 individuals have been identified in 2019 for buying goods from a dark web supplier, most probably drugs.

Offences against other Acts and Decrees 	44,577 	46,253 	18,578 	17,008 	5.42
Punishment
The most common punishments are fines and probation. Community service is also a punishment. These are generally effective in preventing a repetition of an offence. The day fine system is in effect; this means, that if an offence warrants fines, they are calculated in proportion to the offender's income when this is higher than the minimum fine.
Lengths of prison sentences have increased in recent years, though Finnish prison terms are exceptionally short in the international context. Drug trafficking and manslaughter result in the longest prison sentences, of 8–12 years (15 years if multiple crimes), after premeditated murder. Although life sentences are given for murder, probation is given after 10 years at the earliest if the offender was under 21 years of age, otherwise 12 years is the minimum. People under 18 years cannot be sentenced to life sentence, but the maximum sentence is 15 years. There is also possibility of presidential amnesty at any time. Therefore, effective life sentences are enforced in only cases of involuntary commitment of murderers.
The last time capital punishment was enforced in peacetime was in 1825 (see: Tahvo Putkonen). In the Finnish Civil War (1918) and in the 3 wars of World War II (1939–1945): Winter War, Continuation War and Lapland War capital punishment was enforced e.g. Arndt Pekurinen. The death penalty was abolished in 1971.
Finland is more focussed on rehabilitation than retribution.
Rate of incarceration
--
The average number of prisoners was 2 800 in 2020.
Policing
Finland has 130 police officers per 100,000 people. The United States has 298 per 100,000 and Germany has 372. In 2021, police officers accounted for 7 450 of the total police personnel.

	>Generally try to avoid the eastern part of the city such as Vuosaari, Puotila and mellumäki
	My favorite Helsinki hotel is right about there. Stayed there several times, never had any problems in the neighbourhood. Granted, never walked around at night. One time saw some Hitler posters in the neighbourhood, but those were quickly torn off and taken down (in a couple of hours).

	Sorry pia but you prove the point tht Finland is racist with " you have the rest of the world to go and be dark in"... like it's a choice you confirm the racist stereotype.
pia on Jul 14, 2022:
	"As a black woman the best Nordic country is Sweden, then Denmark and Iceland..." who gives a toss? You have most of the world to go and be dark in....oh wait, you won't get special treatment anywhere else will you. As you clearly didn't in Finland where you were treated as an equal but that's not enough for you.

	Crime is low. Extremely low. However, when it does happen you can be sure that no one will step up and help you. It is part of Finnish culture to not intervene on other people business. Actually, Finnish people do intervene on other people business but just not when there is conflict.
	This is a part of Finland that is not discussed. You can be surrounded by strangers, get harassed or punched by someone and other people would just ignore. No one will even call a police for you.
	There is a reason why family bonds in Finland are weak, and why the culture is unsocial. It's a breeding ground for parallel societies, just like in Sweden. In fact, knife crime and gang activity has increased lately. Just keep these in mind if you want to move in.

	As a Canadian once living in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, and Victoria. I have never witnessed a crime in Helsinki, idk what all these ppl on here are yapping about, i seen Helsinki's worst area And have concluded that is probably better than half the areas in winnipeg. I have never witnessed racism, and i am part native american. The only time i seen people fighting was east indians fighting each other drunk in a park, or taxi drivers. Best decision i ever made in my life was moving to Finland.

	As long as you avoid Eastern Helsinki you'll be fine
Anonymous on Jun 20, 2021:
	Finland is the most racist "Scandinavian" country due to the fact, most Finns are a mixture of backwards Eastern Europeans,Sami and a little Nordic blood, due to its close proximity to Russia, Estonia etc, their population has some of the worst people you will ever encounter, fascists,uneducated, alcoholic hillbillies are all found there, and most real Scandinavians don't consider Finland a Nordic country, there is a little controversy about that and they lose it if you mention they are not Scandinavians.
	The only Finns I know (biggest ethnicity in Sweden apart from Swedes) are very nice and humble people plus true Finns , but when you go to Finland you will encounter those mentioned above and most have a huge problem, not only with blacks but anyone who isn't white.
	Know so many Arabs,Somalis,East Asians etc that have moved from both Finland and Norway due to racism and now call Sweden home
	As a black woman the best Nordic country is Sweden, then Denmark and Iceland, Norway isn't' the great utopia everyone thinks it is.You need to visit to see their true colours which are not very nice.
Briony on Feb 26, 2021:
	I’m an American who has been living in Helsinki for nearly two years with my husband. We live right in the city center. I have to say the city is so safe. You can walk the streets at 2 am alone as a female & feel perfectly safe. You might get hit on a by a drunk person but they are harmless, just annoying. There is a park next to our apartment building & If I have to take my dog out in the middle of the night the park is super safe! I’m sure there is some petty crime but violent crime is extremely rare!!

	i would say Oulu is the most dangerous city in Finland followed by Helsinki
ukko on Oct 18, 2020:
	Eastern Helsinki is an absolute shithole. You literally have a street renamed to Mogadishu street
Dean on May 28, 2020:
	I was in Finland 50 years ago..... and the whole of Scandinavia was a haven of liberal tolerance, civilisation and civic-mindedness....now, as I peruse the crime statistics on various sites it's obvious that large-scale immigration has had the same effect on Western culture as in France, Britain and Germany. If only the government could welcome the genuine refugees and expel the majority of parasitic profiteers whose only reason for migrating is to sponge off the benefits. self-imposed segregation and the practice of barbaric cultures will continue to erode everything that made Scandinavia a wonderful and envied place to live. Finland has no historical reason to feel any "white guilt" related to colonialism.... so why copy the woke self-hating reflexes of other Western countries? I'm sure the conditions in Finnish prisons are really horrific and deter the most savage criminals from committing their narcissistic crimes LOLOL
Tore Välimäki on Nov 02, 2019:
	Im from Helsinki so listen up. Generally try to avoid the eastern part of the city such as Vuosaari, Puotila and mellumäki. You stay away from there you will be fine.

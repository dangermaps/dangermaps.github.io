Griechenland: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise
Stand - 19.07.2023
(Unverändert gültig seit: 10.07.2023)
Sicherheit
Terrorismus
-    Beachten Sie den weltweiten Sicherheitshinweis.
Innenpolitische Lage
Es kommt immer wieder zu Protesten und Demonstrationen. Vereinzelte gewaltsame Auseinandersetzungen und Verkehrsbehinderungen können nicht ausgeschlossen werden.
Aufgrund der geografischen Lage ist Griechenland ein bedeutsames Einreiseland für Migranten in die EU bzw. in den Schengenraum. Von Griechenland aus versuchen viele Personen, insbesondere über die Fährhäfen Patras und Igoumenitsa, ohne erforderliche Dokumente weiter nach Italien und andere Schengenländer zu reisen.
-    Informieren Sie sich über die lokalen Medien.
-    Meiden Sie Demonstrationen und größere Menschenansammlungen weiträumig.
-    Beachten Sie bei Benutzung des Fährverkehrs mit eigenem Fahrzeug die Reiseinfos - Infrastruktur/Verkehr.
-    Folgen Sie den Anweisungen lokaler Sicherheitskräfte.
Kriminalität
Vor allem in den Großstädten Athen, Thessaloniki und Piräus kommt es vermehrt zu Kleinkriminalität wie Taschendiebstählen und Handtaschenraub. Dies gilt ganz besonders für belebte Plätze und öffentliche Verkehrsmittel, wie insbesondere die Metro- und Buslinien vom/zum Flughafen und für die Metro- und Busstationen in den Innenstädten.
Autoaufbrüche und Trickdiebstähle gegenüber Autotouristen kommen vor.
-    Seien Sie in Großstädten und dort vor allem an Flughäfen, Bahnhöfen und in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln wie insbesondere der Metro besonders aufmerksam und achten Sie auf Ihre Wertsachen.
-    Bewahren Sie Geld, Ausweise, Führerschein und andere wichtige Dokumente sicher auf; speichern Sie ggf. elektronische Kopien/Fotos. Dies erleichtert im Falle von Diebstahl oder Verlust die Ausstellung eines Ersatzdokuments.
-    Parken Sie Ihr Fahrzeug auf bewachten Parkplätzen, und lassen Sie keine Wertsachen zurück.
-    Bevorzugen Sie bargeldlose Zahlungen, und nehmen Sie nur das für den Tag benötigte Bargeld und keine unnötigen Wertsachen mit.
-    Seien Sie bei ungewohnten E-Mails, Telefonanrufen, Gewinnmitteilungen, Angeboten und Hilfsersuchen angeblicher Bekannter skeptisch. Teilen Sie keine Daten von sich mit, sondern vergewissern Sie sich ggf. persönlich oder wenden Sie sich an die Polizei.
Natur und Klima
Erdbeben und Vulkane
Das Festland und die Inseln Griechenlands liegen in einer seismisch aktiven Zone, weshalb es häufiger zu Erdbeben und seltener zu vulkanischen Aktivitäten kommen kann.
Stürme und Überschwemmungen
Im Mittelmeer kann es insbesondere von August bis November vereinzelt zu schweren Herbststürmen bis hin zu sogenannten Medicanes kommen. Diese führen häufig zu Überschwemmungen und Erdrutschen und in der Folge zu erheblichen Verkehrsbehinderungen.
Busch- und Waldbrände
Vor allem in den Sommermonaten kommt es in Griechenland aufgrund der herrschenden klimatischen Bedingungen immer wieder zu Busch- und Waldbränden. Mit einer Beeinträchtigung der Infrastruktur auch in Tourismusgebieten muss in diesen Fällen gerechnet werden.
-    Beachten Sie stets Verbote, Hinweisschilder und Warnungen sowie die Anweisungen lokaler Behörden.
-    Informieren Sie sich über die Medien, Ihr Hotel und Ihren Reiseleiter über von Bränden betroffene Gebiete und meiden Sie diese.
-    Machen Sie sich mit Verhaltenshinweisen bei Erdbeben, Vulkanen und Tsunamis vertraut. Diese bieten die Merkblätter des Deutschen GeoForschungsZentrums.
-    Im Fall einer Sturmwarnung beachten Sie die Hinweise zu Wirbelstürmen im Ausland bzw. die Hinweise des Bundesamts für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe.
Reiseinfos
LGBTIQ
Es gibt keine Hinweise auf besondere Schwierigkeiten, die Akzeptanz ist insbesondere in Großstädten gut ausgeprägt.
Hinweise für LGBTIQ
Verhaltenshinweise vor Ort
Sie unterliegen stets den Gesetzen des jeweiligen Reiselandes. In vielen Ländern können einvernehmliche gleichgeschlechtliche sexuelle Aktivitäten, öffentliche Versammlungen oder das Zeigen von LGBTIQ-Symbolen wie der Regenbogen-Flagge illegal sein.
Das Einverständnisalter für hetero- und homosexuelle Beziehungen kann auch im selben Land variieren. Ihr Verhalten kann in einigen Ländern auch Einheimische gefährden und eine öffentliche Geste der Zuneigung die andere Person ihren Job, die Familie oder gar ihr Leben kosten.
-    Seien Sie besonders umsichtig, wenn Sie Kontakt zur lokalen Bevölkerung aufnehmen. In einigen Ländern überwacht die Polizei Webseiten, mobile Dating-Apps oder Treffpunkte bzw. nimmt LGBTIQ-Personen gezielt über Fake-Accounts ins Visier.
-    Verhalten Sie sich im Zweifel diskret, lassen Sie sich nicht auf Diskussionen am falschen Ort ein, sondern reagieren Sie einfach nicht und verlassen Sie den Ort möglichst. Dies schließt je nach Schwere eines Vorfalls die Möglichkeit auch einer Anzeige bei Behörden nicht aus.
-    Lassen Sie Speisen und Getränke nicht unbeaufsichtigt. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass ihnen unbemerkt Substanzen wie K.o.-Tropfen beigemischt werden. Drogenaktivierte Vergewaltigungen sind weltweit verbreitet. Beachten Sie, dass in einigen Ländern Vergewaltigungsopfer (des anderen wie auch des gleichen Geschlechts) als Täter einer Straftat angesehen werden können.
-    Achten Sie auf Safer Sex, da einige Länder eine höhere Rate an sexuell übertragbaren Infektionen (STI) haben, insbesondere in der LGBTIQ-Gemeinschaft. In vielen Ländern, insbesondere Entwicklungsländern, haben viele Menschen keinen Zugang zu HIV-Tests.

General crime information about Greece from Wikipedia:
<<<BEGIN[wikipedia]
Crime in Greece is combated by the Hellenic Police and other agencies.
During the 1980s, Greek Police Chief Nikon Arkoudeas (Νίκων Αρκουδέας) led an intense campaign against organized crime, which saw significant success. Since the early 1990s, many illegal immigrants have come to Greece from Eastern European and Southeast European countries, Africa and South Asia.
The Greek Police also had several victories, breaking up mafia organizations, arresting the 17 November terrorist group, successfully organizing security for the 2004 Olympic Games and for breaking up in 2016 the largest criminal organization in the country, responsible for more than 2,000 robberies.
Crime by type
Murder
In 2011, Greece had a murder rate of 1.7 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 184 murders in Greece in 2011.
Number of homicides per year in Greece from 2000 to 2019
Sources: Hellenic Police. Annual crime data reports.
Organized crime
Organized crime in Greece is on the rise. Domestic as well as foreign criminal groups are well-entrenched in Greek society. Traditionally, people associated with organized crime were known as Men of the night (άνθρωποι της νύχτας). Out of the foreign criminal groups the Albanian mafia is the most prevalent. The activities of the Albanian crime groups in Greece include drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion and robbery among others.
Albanian criminal groups often export other immigrants to Greece, especially Middle Eastern and Pakistani shopkeepers, and control many nightclubs in the working-class districts of West Athens. Russian groups are less numerous, but they are very heavily armed and dangerous; they are involved in arms trafficking, extortion and cigarette smuggling. Lower-level Romanian and Moldavian groups are involved in theft and human trafficking.
Domestic, ethnic Greek criminal organizations are the most powerful and politically well-connected and extensively cooperate with Albanian groups, often hiring Albanians to act as enforcers. Greek criminal organizations are involved in human trafficking, extortion, drug trafficking, kidnapping and the infiltration of legal businesses. They have profited from the rising corruption. That is evident in the fact that Greek crime groups have infiltrated the shipping industry, which is used to traffic cocaine and heroin into the Greek mainland and abroad.
Property crime
As of 2011, Greece has seen an increase in property-related crime, thought to be linked to the worsening of economic conditions. Robberies, ranging from street muggings to bank hold-ups and house burglaries, totaled about 80,000 in 2009, up from about 50,000 in 2005. The increase in property crime has seen an increase in the amount of work for private security companies. Nevertheless, the crime rate is still among the lowest in Western Europe.
In 2016, the Greek police successfully broke up the country's largest criminal organization in Greece's history, which was responsible for more than 2,000 house burglaries across the country, in an operation where at least 1,000 policemen and 37 judges participated.
Immigrant crime
The Greek police have admitted that armed gangs entering the country from neighbouring Albania or Bulgaria could have been attracted by reports that many people have been withdrawing cash from banks and stashing it in their homes. There are possibly more than 1 million illegal immigrants inside Greece as of 2012. Cases of immigrant crime such as the 2012 Paros rape have attracted nationwide interest.
Illegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from the Arab world and South Asia — mainly Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, and Pakistan — to Greece appear to have increased as well.
The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008.
In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for "illegal entry or stay" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians.
Tax evasion and corruption
Greece suffers from relatively high levels of tax evasion and political corruption, even though in recents years there has been considerable decrease. This is to the extent that tax evasion has been described by Greek politicians as "a national sport" - with up to €30 billion per year going uncollected.
Extent of Greek tax evasion
The OECD estimated in August 2009 that the size of the Greek black market to be around €65bn (equal to 25% of GDP), resulting each year in €20bn of unpaid taxes. This is a European record in relative terms, and in comparison almost twice as big as the German black market (estimated to be 15% of GDP).
Several successive Greek governments had in the past attempted to improve the situation, but all failed due to tax evasion's place within Greek culture. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work.
In the last quarter of 2005, participation in tax evasion reached an estimated 49% of the population, while in January 2006 it fell to 41.6%. A study by researchers from the University of Chicago concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was €28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year.
The Tax Justice Network has said that there are over €20 billion in Swiss bank accounts held by Greeks. The former Finance Minister of Greece, Evangelos Venizelos, was quoted as saying "Around 15,000 individuals and companies owe the taxman 37 billion euros". Additionally, the TJN puts the number of Greek-owned off-shore companies to over 10,000.
By location
Athens
Armed robberies in Athens doubled between 2007 and 2009. Thefts and break-ins jumped from 26,872 recorded cases in 2007, to 47,607 in 2009. The number of murders in Athens nearly doubled between 2007 and 2009.
Police politics
One of the major criticisms addressed to the Greek Police by the Greek media is the politicization of its officer corps. Up until 1981 (when Andreas Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement party came to power), almost all senior officers of the Greek Gendarmerie and the Cities Police were inveterate right-wingers. These two agencies were merged in 1984 to create the Greek Police.

Carol H on Jun 17, 2023:
	We arrived 6/15/23. Took hired driver from airport to our hotel. Streets blocked off due to riots. Driver puts us out 1 km from hotel. We had to take luggage thru riot got gassed by the police gassing the rioters and we were robbed. Tourist police would not allow us to say we were robbed on the report. All our cash, credit cards were stolen. We were afraid to tour Athens, so we got a flight out asap. Will never come back.

PlagiaSkepsi on Jan 21, 2023:
	We were Europe's SAFEST country until 1991... Then we wrongfully accepted albanians (europe's archcriminals) and then georgians, pakistanis, algerians, moroccans etc. Yes, 90% of Greece's crimes (according to OFFICIAL stats) originates from those plus the gypsies. DO YOU REALLY WANT A SAFE EUROPE? You know the answer...
The Atgenean on Jan 18, 2023:
	Greek having grown up in Athens here
	While crime isn't uncommon, I think these estimates exaggerate the level for most areas & if you take the necessary precautions nothing will happen to you. Omonoia, Acharnes/Menidi & Zefyri are the most affected areas that you should avoid but if you're careful you should be safe outside these parts.
	I give crime index a 35, safety during daylight 75 & safety during night 60

	Athens is a very very dangerous city things are a lot worse then these numbers. My advise to tourists see the Parthenon and get the hell out there is not much to see but filth and the city has a smell of a public washroom. Bad experience

	I am a 57 year old Englishman who has lived for 12 years in central Athens, during this time I have never felt threatened or unsafe, and yet I have walked around extensively to many areas of the city that look rough or run down, always with a camera visible as I am a keen photographer. Having lived and worked in 11 large cities around the world including Caracas and Nairobi, I would like to state that Athens is safe if you obviously listen to local advice and take the normal precautions as a tourist in any big city particularly during the night.

	Very very dangerous City.I will never go again.
Mitsos93 on Feb 16, 2020:
	I'm a Greek, living in Athens. It's an unsafe and ugly city, full of mentally ill people... You can see people screaming alone, many illegal immigrants, many junkies and many homeless. At the ghetto areas, sometimes you can hear gunshots even on daylight or get stabbed from thieves. Almost all of the (few) parks in the city, have been occupied by drug addicts and criminals. If you stay at the tourist areas, probably you will be fine. Just be aware of the pickpockets there...

	I don't know what all say but when I visited greece I was robbed 3 times and the first by violence they hit me in the head. And sometimes the thieves can kill you with a knife only for 10euro..... Athens and some other cities is the problem in Greece when I visited the islands I understand that greece is safe countries if someone want to go in athens is only for parthenon. The other things are very strange and gringe

	Athens isn’t particularly dangerous.
	Crime statistics point toward the fact that it’s actually quite a safe city for travelers—Athens is not included on lengthy lists of the world’s most dangerous cities.
	Heavy crimes like murder, rape etc its pretty low, probably Athens in that aspect is one of the safest cities in the world.
	Still, there are certain things that travelers to Athens should keep in mind to ensure the safest possible visit.
	Stay vigilant for pickpockets and other petty thieves, scammers, these are the most common crimes targeting travelers in Athens. Be especially cautious at crowded attractions, on public transportation, and in taxis, where drivers sometimes scam their passengers for higher fees. Generally though they're very helpful and safe. Plus you can use an app (taxi beat or uber) to get a taxi this way you always get the right rate.
	The most prominent form of crime in Athens is, as you might guess, pickpocketing. By all accounts, pickpocketing, purse snatching, and other forms of petty theft are common, especially at crowded tourist attractions, nightlife destinations, and on buses and trains, where you should take extra care to guard your belongings. Be particularly vigilant if someone seems like they’re trying to distract you; meanwhile, someone else may be reaching into your purse.
	The rest of Greece is Very safe especially the Islands.
	Enjoy your stay and the food! :)
Jesica on Dec 22, 2019:
	It is a country that you will see very weird things very different culture. The thinks is not so good the greeks must do something to fix their problems
Kimmy on Nov 06, 2019:
	As a Greek, I know that in Athens, there is a chance of 99% to get cheated or stolen by taxi drivers, pickpockets, beggars, walking floggers (flowers) blah blah blah. Especially in public transportation, touristic neighborhoods (aka Monastiraki), when you are chilling in a restaurant, a coffee shop, even in a dance club, or at the beach.
	To avoid an unpleasant situation, I would suggest you follow some basic rules.
	Before you get in a taxi, always ask for the price. The daily fixed-rate from the airport to the city is 38-40€, the nightly about €60. If a driver force you to pay more, then you should call the police (tel.100)
	Don't hold a lot of money on you; much better use your credit card.
	Avoid a luxurious appearance. Expensive items (jewelry, watches, smartphones, etc.) attract criminals.
	NEVER leave your mobile on the table of a restaurant or a coffee shop, bar, club, etc
	Leave your passport at the hotel!
	Don't trust street people that unexpectedly approach you. Leave them behind, and don't talk. Sometimes they are working as a team, so one person is keeping you busy, while the other is removing your valuable items. It's ok for someone to be rude in Greece, don't worry!
	Women avoid taking a handbag if you don't need it.
	In a restaurant, pub, bar, whatever, ask for the menu...so you can check the prices.
	Women solely, who are planning to visit the Greek islands, must be aware of rapists when they are costuming alcohol. Don't trust every dude who is talking to you in a bar.
	During the night, please avoid visiting Philopappos hill and generally don't walk in sketchy neighborhoods alone in the dark.
	That's all. I hope that I didn't shock you; otherwise, Athens is a bitcheerful city. Enjoy
Ted on Oct 23, 2019:
	I am Greek (Athenian) currently living and working in the US for the last couple of decades, but go back almost every year to visit. Athens ranks as the 45th safest city out of all the cities in the world, way ahead of many US and European cities. If you visit Athens I would recommend that you stick to the tourist sites (if you are not Greek), same with most other cities, and use common sense. Limit your night excursions if you can or are paranoid. If you don't just go out with others as a group to places locals recommend or go themselves. Always ask the taxi driver which areas are safe and how late you can safely stay out, or if you can walk around past a certain time. They are well aware of what goes on and where, and will give you good advice. Same with the people working at your hotel. I would highly recommend you spend most of your stay in Greece at the islands which are extremely safe. There are so many beautiful islands, we try to visit at least 2 different ones every time we are there. We only stay at our place in Athens for a couple of days and 2 weeks at different islands. Some times we revisit islands but we limit our time in Athens, because after all Athens is a big city, and we don't like vacationing in cities. We like the peace and tranquility of most Greek isles and their beaches. And the only places in Athens we go to eat when we are there, are the restaurants by the water with ocean view (Glyfada, Pasalimani, etc.) which are safe, and we always call for a taxi, and avoid walking around at night, unless it's a Square (Platia) full of stores and people like our local one in Nea Smirni (Athens suburb), or other Squares in the northern (more expensive) suburbs where we have relatives. Athens is not the city it used to be when I used to walk 1+ miles to school by myself starting at the age of 7 and noone bothered me. That was 40+ years ago. Unfortunately poor Albanians and other immigrants have moved in the last 20 years with bad intentions.. The pick pocket, rob, burglarize or worse... every opportunity they get. It's not the (safe) Athens of my youth. To me it's just another city now. Visit the Acropolis, a couple of museums, and then hit the islands! That's where all the Greeks and half the world spend their vacation, so why stay in Athens for more than a couple of days?

	16 years in Greece. Never had a single problem. One of the safest cities I know (besides Geneva where nothing ever happens anyway). Of course, as someone complained about, you go to Exarcheia on a Saturday evening when there is some jubilee... well whould you go to the deep spanish quarter in Miami for dinner, St.Denis in Paris? Numbers confirm it is very safe. Just enjoy.

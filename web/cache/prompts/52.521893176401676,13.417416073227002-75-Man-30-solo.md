General crime information about Federal Republic of Germany from Wikipedia:
<<<BEGIN[wikipedia]
Crime in Germany is handled by the German police forces and other agencies.
Recent trends
Statistics
The official statistics PKS 2018 of 2018 by the Bundeskriminalamt for the year 2017 shows an increase of 39.9% for resistance and attacks against state authority, 13.6% in the spreading of pornographic material, 8.3% in crimes against the German drug law, 6.1% for narcotic-related crimes generally and 5.5% in violations of the German arms law.
On the other hand, there is a decrease by 18.2% in sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment including cases with lethal consequences, 16.3% in burglaries, 9.3% in violations of the immigration laws, 7.6% in fraud, 7.5% in theft and 6% in street crime.[1]
European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)
In the EU-SILC survey, respondents were questioned about whether they experienced problems with violence, crime, or vandalism in the area where they live. Between 2010 and 2017, the EU crime average dropped by 3%. All countries in the EU except Germany, Sweden, and Lithuania showed a falling trend of criminal incidents.[3]
By type
According to Germany's 2010 crime statistics, 5.93 million criminal acts were committed, which was 2% lower than in 2009.[4] According to the Interior Ministry, this was the first time the figure had fallen below six million offenses since 1991 (the year after reunification), and is the lowest crime level since records began.[4] The rate of crimes solved in 2010 was 56%, a record high from 2009's 55.6%.[4]
In 2010, internet-related crime climbed 8.1%, with around 224,000 reported cases.[4] The number of house burglaries in 2010 also increased by 6.6%.[4]
Domestic violence
According to 2015 statistics, there were 127,000 victims of domestic violence. (German: Häusliche Gewalt) 82% of the victims were female. This represented an increase of 5.5% over 2012 statistics. The most commonly reported crime was bodily harm, defined as a slap or a strike of sufficient force to warrant prosecution. Other common crimes were threats (14.4%), grievous bodily harm (German: schwere Körperverletzung), and injury with a deadly outcome (German: Verletzung mit Todesfolge) at 12%. A fourth of the suspects were reported to be intoxicated from the consumption of alcohol.[5]
Ex-partner victims were mostly targeted by stalking.[5]
Murder
The homicide rate in Germany is similarly low to the EU and other developed countries. Homicides increased rapidly in the early 1990s, increasing from 931 in 1990 to 2,032 - 2.5 per 100,000 in 1995 and gradually decreasing in the next 15 years before stabilizing at lower rates from around 2010 (0.98 per 100,000 or 783) to the present with 782 in 2020 at a rate of 0.93 per 100,000.[6]
Organized crime
In the 1990s, the power balance changed in the red light districts of Germany when Russian, Yugoslav, and Albanian organizations started to operate. In parts of Germany, police asked themselves whether they had suppressed German gangs too much as the gangs that took over were more brutal foreign gangs.[8]
In 2017, statistics suggested that German citizens constitute the largest group of suspects in organized crime trials. From 2016 to 2017, the proportion of non-German citizen organized crime suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7%. 14.9% of the German citizens involved held different citizenship at birth.[7]
Italian organized crime
The 'Ndrangheta, Camorra, and Cosa Nostra all operate in Germany. The 'Ndrangheta has the most robust presence. There are an estimated 1,200 members of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta active in Germany, mostly in the cocaine trade. Apart from the 'Ndrangheta, the Neapolitan Camorra has also infiltrated the construction industry in Germany. Five Sicilian Mafia groups are active in the country, but seem to have lost power.[9] Italian crime groups can mostly be found in the Ruhr district and in the west of Germany.
In December 2018, German police conducted an operation against the 'Ndrangheta in Germany and arrested 90 suspects for suspected drug dealing and money laundering. Forty-seven suspects were prosecuted.[10]
Outlaw motorcycle gangs
OMCGs such as Hells Angels, Bandidos, Gremium and more recently, Satudarah, Rock Machine and Night Wolves, are active throughout Germany. While not all members of motorcycle clubs are criminals, many are reputed to be involved in the red-light districts and the bouncer scene, who control a large portion of the drug trade within bars and clubs.[9]
Balkan crime gangs
People from the Balkans have strong connections to their home country where they can go underground when they want to evade police. Mafia gangs from Kosovo, Croatia, and Albania have close-knit structures similar to those of the Arab clans. Gangs from Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina have a strong tendency to use violence and according to police, are not discouraged by ordinary police as they have fought in the Yugoslav Wars. A number of these gangsters are ex-special forces who served under warlords during the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Gangs from the Balkans are active in illegal gambling, protection rackets, narcotics trade and human trafficking. The Yugoslav wars also mean these gangs have access to firearms, where 700 thousand weapons were stolen in Albania alone.[11]
Serbian mafia
The Zemun clan is active in Germany and mainly involved in drug trafficking and prostitution. Members are largely ethnic Serbs, some of them former soldiers, but Montenegrins and Bosniaks from the Serbian region are part of the ex-Yugoslavian gangs as well.[12]
Russian mafia
Russian-speaking crime groups, in particular, the Tambov gang are active in cities such as Düsseldorf. Money laundering, prostitution and extortion seem to be their activities of choice. Aside from the Russian groups, Georgian, Armenia and Chechen crime groups are active in Germany as well. Very often these gangs and the Russian groups are named together in one breath even when they have little to do with each other.
Another major form of Russian-speaking organized crime in Germany consists of so-called criminal Aussiedler families. Aussiedlers are ethnic Germans (also called Volga Germans, Russia Germans) that were born in the former Soviet Union. While a lot of Aussiedlers adapted well and quickly mastered the German language, a lot of families held onto the traditional lifestyle they lived in Russia and surrounding states. This led to the formation of individual as well as clan-based groups of Aussiedlers involved in organized criminal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, prostitution, as well as extreme violence. Due to a large number of Aussiedlers they are seen as the major form of Russian organized crime in Germany.[13]
Turkish mafia
Turkish crime groups which consist of mafia clans from Turkey are active throughout Germany in extortion, weapon trafficking and drug trafficking. Often the gangs can be linked to political groups from their home country, such as the Grey Wolves for right-wing Turks and Dev Sol for left-wing Turks.
In 2014, the annual report on organized crime presented in Berlin by Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizière, showed that there were 61 Turkish gangs in Germany. According to the report, alongside their more traditional fields of drug smuggling, gangs are also increasingly turning their attention to burglary, car theft, and fraud. 10% of Germany's gang members were reported to be Turkish and according to statistics, the activity of Turkish gangs in Germany had decreased.[14][15]
In 2016, Die Welt and Bild reported that the new Turkish motorbike gang, Osmanen Germania, was growing rapidly. The newspaper Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung claimed that the Osmanen Germania was advancing more and more into the red-light districts, which increases the likelihood of a bloody territorial battle with established gangs like the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and the Mongols Motorcycle Club.[16][17][18][19][20][21]
Middle Eastern crime clans
Middle Eastern crime clans have become a major player in the underworld of Germany since the mass emigration of large Middle Eastern families, also called Großfamilie. Especially in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen Middle Eastern clans are highly active in heroin trafficking as well as being involved in the bouncer-scene. Middle Eastern crime families mostly have origins in Lebanon, Afghanistan (mainly in Hamburg) and Morocco (mostly in Frankfurt).
Middle Eastern crime clans come from different backgrounds, but the most numerous of them are the Arab clans such as the Al-Zein Clan and the Miri clan among others.
According to a research conducted by the Abba Eban Institute Archived 2019-10-23 at the Wayback Machine as part of an initiative called Janus Initiative, Hezbollah has built up its own international drug trafficking and money laundering network, with mafia-like structures. The research is focusing on the ties between organized crime and Hezbollah and found clans in Germany that are specifically supporting Hezbollah. According to the Abba Eban Institute, members of the three Shiite extended families Chahrour, Berjawi and Balhas are based in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia, and are deeply involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.[22]
Afghan gangs
Afghan clans are active in Hamburg, a city with a large Afghan population. Like the Turkish as well as Albanian gangs in the city, Afghan organized crime is active in hashish and heroin trafficking, extortion and prostitution.[23][24]
North Africans Gangs
Moroccan organized crime groups, have been reported in Frankfurt. Next to the Serbian mafia and Balkan gangs, the Moroccan organized crime has become one of the active main players in the Frankfurt underworld for heroin trade as well as other criminal activities.[25]
Vietnamese crime groups
Vietnamese groups active in human trafficking and cigarette smuggling have been reported in Germany. Chinese Triads on the other hand have also been reported but don't seem to have substantial power in Germany.[9]
Corruption
Transparency International’s Global corruption barometer 2013 revealed that political parties and businesses are the most corrupt institutions in Germany. The same report also indicated that petty corruption is not as uncommon as other European countries. The survey showed that 11% of the respondents claim to have been asked to pay a bribe at one point in their life and only a few of those said that they had refused to pay the bribe.[26]
By nationality
Share of foreign nationals among 2017 crime suspects
Pickpocketing 	74.4%
Forgery of official documents	55.4%
Burglaries	41.3%
Rapes and sexual assaults	37%
All types	34.7%
Social benefit fraud	34.1%
Murder and manslaughter	29.7%
Share of population	12%
Source: Wall Street Journal
In 2018, The Wall Street Journal analyzed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart.[27]
In 2016, 31.4% of all convicted offenders were foreigners,[28] about 3 times higher than the percentage of foreigners living in Germany.[29]
According to The Huffington Post in February 2018, out of each of the 15 state justice ministries, 12,300 Muslims are in prison. This constitutes about 20% of the 65,000 prison population in Germany, proving to be an over-representation. The highest shares are in city states of Bremen (29%), Hamburg (28%) but the share is high also in large states such as Hessen (26%) Baden-Württemberg (26%). The share is lower in the former East Germany.[30]
In 2018, the interior ministry published an analysis of the Federal Police Statistic (PKS) for the first time, which included all the people who came via the asylum system into Germany.[31] The report found that the group defined as immigrants, which constitutes 2% of the total population, makes up 8.5% of all crime suspects.[32]
By location
Crimes such as drug trafficking, weapon trafficking, extortion, prostitution, money laundering and contract killing are mostly present in poorly maintained areas of urban centers such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hannover, Duisburg, Cologne or Düsseldorf.

Crime is much higher in reality than most european cities
Anonymous on Feb 06, 2023:
	I have lived in Germany since 2009, and Berlin since 2013. Without a doubt has the city become more dangerous. Not only have I witnessed countless acts of aggression, small and large in recent years, i have also had my nose broken walking on Ku'damm on a Saturday afternoon at 18.00 by a group of young men. And I am also sorry to reinforce the cliche, but it was a group with a middle eastern background (but strong Berlin accents).
	Certain areas are absolute no-go's - Neukolln Sonnenallee. Absolutely intolerant and frankly dangerous. Avoid like the plague!
NYC to Berlin on Jan 19, 2023:
	Nein.
	I've been to Berlin (and other cities in Germany,) before and know people who live in Berlin. The increase in crime has happening internationally--especially with the beginning of the Covid-19 era. Rightwing zealots can whine all they want about immigration but it's actually the desperation fueled by the spiraling crisis of capitalism. Trust me, crime is much worse here in NYC than it is in your lovely garden of Berlin. I don't doubt that some neighborhoods have gotten rough, but facts are facts--social services, low cost of living, and a relatively strong labor movement are the only things keeping you all from ruin.
Anonymous on Jan 10, 2023:
	I am born in Berlin and living here since 50 years. Berlin has failed districts, like Neukölln, Wedding. and some Parts of Tiergarten and Kreuzberg. In the last 7 years we have much more unemployed and homeless people which living on the streets and in parks. That we had have never before so many. And we have much more drug crime. Often You can have trouble with some aggressive people in the Metro or on the street, and many of younger people have a knife . I get trouble with a young drug dealer, which sales his drug in a Metro wagon on am 11:00 and did he very aggressive. He hit me, no one helps me, and the Metro guard going very fast away.
	And this is not one thing. Many of people in my neighborhood told me crazy stories. No, this town is not so safe as it was for some years.
Anonymous on Jan 05, 2023:
	anyone still has any doubts about the crime following the latest firework attacks on the police and the ambulance on New Year's eve?
	You can thank the far left for creating this parallel world.
Anonymous on Aug 02, 2022:
	in 1 month of vacation I got robbed in broad daylight at an ATM next to a Synangogue and the police didnt even care only told me a patrol would come for me, a friend got assaulted by 3 men in the tram at night on his way home because he wouldnt give them 10euros, another friend also almost got robbed in front of a restaurant. Berlin is a shithole stay away if you can.
Anonymous on Jul 05, 2022:
	This page is all lies. Berlin is probably one of the safest cities in the world. I have walked around the "worst" places in the middle of the night with 0 fear. The only interesting thing you see is the occasional insane drug addict hobo.
	The "values" here are literally just averages of what people send in at the survey thing, so genius American /pol/ users that heard about the "rapefugee" storm and still think its 2015 flood it with the results they want and then turn around to use them as an argument in the comments.
Lex on Jun 17, 2022:
	This is exactly like in the state of Florida in the USA
Ich on Sep 29, 2021:
	It depends very much on the neighborhood. There are few hotspots for trouble, just avoid them, especially at night.
Anonymous on Aug 24, 2021:
	i might be moving to berlin for university and to be honest, i am getting very concerned for my safety just by reading the comment section.
Anonymous on Jul 08, 2021:
	Every day another stabbing. Females dont feel safe here for the past years. Its getting worse as the data shows
Compare? on May 03, 2021:
	Here you go:
	Kabul, Afghanistan Crime Index: 76.06
	Damascus, Syria: 68.40
	Lagos, Nigeria: 64.82
	Tripoli, Libya: 64.27
	Baghdad, Iraq: 63.29
	Berlin, Germany: 41.14
	Zurich, Switzerland: 16.40
	So yes, Berlin is safer than those cities in Africa and Middle East. For now.
	Continue importing criminals without background checks and you’ll see the same level of crime on the German streets.
	Berlin: Crime increasing in the past 3 years: 68.46 (High)
	What a coincidence!
Compare on Apr 20, 2021:
	Compare these stats to other major cities around the world. Learn how to understand. It never fails that those who state that others can’t think independently are in fact the ones that are projecting their own inefficiency on others. Spend time and look at how these numbers compare and do so without an agenda
anonymous on Apr 17, 2021:
	Thankfully there're still people who think independently and don't buy into the far leftist propaganda in the mass media.
	Crime is real and it's imported. Rapefugees not welcome!
Anonymous on Apr 17, 2021:
	It's very embarrassing that this website allows rightwingers to pollute their site with propaganda, you might aswell seek travel advice from 4chan.
anonymous on Mar 31, 2021:
	It's true and very sad what's happening to Berlin and Germany since they allowed those millions of fake refugees to come.
	Import the third world and you become the third world. Skyrocketing crime is just one of the consequences.
	It's not about race or religion, but about thorough background checks of those who you let into the country.
	Those who raped hundreds of German women in Cologne in 2015 would have been in jail had it happened in Saudi Arabia.
desta kiflemariam on Jan 05, 2021:
	As I have read there is crime in Berlin. BUt this should be minimize as it is not good for the reputation of the city.
Anonymous on Oct 30, 2020:
	no no, they are mostly right. you go in their countries and they behave. you bring over 2 million people with different culture, gangs will form. statistics dont lie
Madiha on Jun 09, 2020:
	I have lived in different parts of Berlin over the last 8 years. other then petty crimes like a wallet being stolen or bikes being stolen never faced anything related to violence. S
	Ashamed to read comments from illiterate people who are equating Africans and Muslims like they are both races. Religions and races are very different things. Crime mostly has only one cause, poverty resulting in bad neighbourhoods.
	Same as any other metropolitan city in the world berlin has some upper and some lower neighbourhoods, which can result in differing crimes. Has nothing to do with religion/race. Period
Anonymous on Mar 31, 2020:
	I can confirm what "Dr. Bolja e Madhe" mentioned below. Subway stations have become quite dangerous especially at night in some zones (wedding, kreuzberg, reinickendorf etc). Also at night buses may not be that safe especially if a bit empty. There are groups (especially of Arabic / Muslims) that have no respect for nobody and may harass you (if you are a women, double your caution). There is also the drunk and drugs guys that you can find especially in subways (even though those are generally harmless). I have also noticed some vandalism including destroying bicycles and even cars.
Dr. Bolja e Madhe on Feb 08, 2020:
	In Berlin is very dangerous in the subway stations. The city has so much people with hate. Not only Arabic people but there are many German people that are bad. I mean the Arabic people have nothing to do with religion so don't insult it. I live here since five years and I must say that after 20:00 is dangerous to walk in zones like Kreuzberg and Wedding because of groups that maybe talk or fight with you.
HopeForChange on Nov 04, 2019:
	Sadly the crime has risen dramatically in Berlin due to a huge influx of immigrants of african and middle eastern origin. This is not racist speak whatsoever, it is plain, bald, inconvenient fact. I know because I lived here for years, and then came back 10 years later. Incomparable.
Anonymous on Sep 21, 2019:
	Living in Berlin for 5 years, not seen any violent act, wife getting home alone at night. Safer than many cities in the US
Anonymous on Sep 13, 2019:
	I went to Berlin during summer vacation. Got attacked on my way to the hotel, got a fractured arm and a dislocated knee for my trouble. 4/10 the food almost made up for it.
	Seriously though, AVOID this city at all costs!
Anonymous on Jul 22, 2019:
	well I am not sure if it is that criminal compared to other places in the world but I used to live in Berlin and my house got broken into and they stole all my gold and money.And the second time they tried to break into my house again but I have seen them and they ran away and they never got caught .
